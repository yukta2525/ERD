# Query Results

Store query results, screenshots, and data exports here.

## What to Include

- Query result screenshots (for documentation)
- Exported CSV files (if needed for further analysis)
- Charts or visualizations (if created)
- Summary statistics

## File Naming

Match result files to their corresponding queries:
```
top_rated_restaurants_by_city.sql
top_rated_restaurants_by_city_results.csv
top_rated_restaurants_by_city_screenshot.png
```

## Large Files

Note: Large CSV files are ignored by `.gitignore` to keep the repository small.
If you need to share large results:
- Upload to OneDrive/Google Drive
- Add a link in the main README or in `docs/team_notes.md`
- Or commit only a sample (first 100 rows)

## Committing Results

Small result files (<1MB) can be committed directly.
Document your findings in the main README instead of committing large datasets.
